This file acts as an automation test run for jitter, rise and fall time transmitter testing.
The script connects to a Keysight 86100A/B/C/D Wide-Bandwidth Oscilloscope via GPIB or TCP/IP to query the instrument.
In an actual script for testing, a loop should be used to wait for full scope acquisition.

The full list of VISA commands can be found at the end of the file.
